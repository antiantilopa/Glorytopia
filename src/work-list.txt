Ctitical errors:
    lobby visual bug (names are not displayed/has white color)
    sawmill texture (it is not done yet... NEEDS to be done VERY soon)

Need to do:
    sounds for events (especially when your turn)
    roads
    game over
    resources visibility and even spawn
    naval update (in)
    settings and config
    
Some improvements:
    premoves
    animations
    tiles destruction by units
    cities spawn and destruction
    support units (like + defence for all units around)
    tier 4 techs with siege units
